# DynaPose Lib

DynaPose is a software-agnostic toolset for real time rigging and procedural animation authoring designed to provide generic, 
real-time data editing capabilities for diverse Game Mods.

Initially this project is meant to provide Procedural animation and rigging to Skyrim SE, though this library could be used
for every other bethesda game through Script Extender plugins, or other games through their own Script extension platforms
